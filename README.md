WORK IN PROGRESS

This library provides 3D mesh representation for wireframe objects, as well as the ability to load OBJ files into the internal format.  Full 3D transformations are provided (local-to-world, world-to-view, etc.), allowing 3D animation and motion to be rendered using, for instance, the stevesch-Display library.
